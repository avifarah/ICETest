Problem 1: Latest prices
You are given a file formatted like this:

A CUSIP is a unique identifier of a security.  You can assume a CUSIP is just an 8-character alphanumeric string.
Think of the file as a record of a day's prices for a set of securities identified by their CUSIPs.
Each CUSIP may have any number of prices (e.g., 95.752, 101.255) following it in
sequence, one per line.
The prices can be considered to be ordered by time in ascending order, earliest to latest.

Write a C++, (and C#) program that will print the closing (or latest) price for each CUSIP in the file. There are about 3,000,000 bonds in the universe.  
100 prices ticks during the day is not unusual.  So, this file might contain 300 million lines, so your solution SHOULD NOT assume the entire file can fit in memory!
