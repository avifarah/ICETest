Assumptions
1)  A Cusip is followed by one or more price lines.  A Cusip line not followed by a price line indicates a corrupt feed file.
2)  A price is a string of digits separated by a single period; explicitly, no comma separation for 1000s.
3)  There are no extraneous characters in a CUSIP or price except potentially leading and trailing blank characters
4)	A Price may have no digits infront of the decimal point but it must have at least one digit after the decimal point
5)  Repeat Cusip in the file are an indication of a currupt feed file.
6)	Last lines of feed file may be blank lines
7)	The dot that you have in the description of the problem represents a continuation.  I struggled a little with it, Cusip1 followed
	by prices followed by a period looking like a period is a sentinel.  However, Cusip2 followed by prices followed by Cusip3 is not
	separated by a period, making it look like the period is an optional sentinel.  Then the next period is between 2 price lines.  As
	such I decided that it means that the period, in this context, is equivalent to an elipses.


Discussion
A cusip is expected to match a line of characters according to the regular expression: "^\\s*\\w{8}\\s*$"
A price is expected to match a line of characters according to the regular expression: "^\\s*\\d*\\.\\d+\\s*$"
Any line not matching either Cusip, regular expressions, Price regular expressions or a sentinel "." line, is in an error

Steps to solution
1)  Open the file
2)  Read the file line by line
3)  For each line read take action as per the following state machine

State machine
The transision between states is the action of line read and matched against either a cusip RE or price RE
State o: Start          Next possible states: c; x
state c: Cusip          Next possible states: p; x
state p: price          Next possible states: p, c, e; x
state x: Exception
state e: End

The Start state (state o) is where we are before we read the first line of data, from the start point we can either read a cusip,
encounter an exception, like the line does not match a cusip, or meet the EOF, which means that the file is empty.

State c is the state that reached by reading a line and it matches the RE of Cusip.  From this state we can read another Cusip, meaning
that this cusip contains no price list.  This cusip may be followed by a price, the more likely option, we can get to the EOF or an exception

state p is the state that is reached by reading a line and it matches the RE of price.  From this state we can read another price, very likely.
We may reach the EOF, we may read another Cusip or we may encounter an exception.
